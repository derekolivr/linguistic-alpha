Our production numbers are solid; we produced 440,808 vehicles in Q1 and delivered 422,875. We stand by our accounting, which is fully audited. This is a clear case of illegal market manipulation."

    "text": "We believe Alphabet is a fantastic business, but it is carrying excessive costs. The number of employees has grown 20% per year since 2017. This is not justified. Management's reluctance to address the bloated headcount and the losses in Other Bets has created uncertainty and risk for shareholders. We allege that this lack of cost control is impacting profitability."
