    "mda_section": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer ride-hailing, maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on AI, robotics and automation. As a result of rapidly evolving trade and fiscal policy, uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase, posing risks to our global supply chain and cost structure which could have a meaningfully adverse impact on demand for our products and our profitability. The current tariff regime will have a relatively larger impact on our energy generation and storage business compared to our automotive business. While we prepare for near-term challenges to our business under current policies, we are focused on long-term growth opportunities as we continue to make prudent investments. In 2025, we produced approximately 1,220,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 1,218,000 consumer vehicles through the third quarter. We are focused on profitable growth via a differentiated and efficiently managed product portfolio that leverages our existing factories and production lines, further improving and deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous capabilities through our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab, reducing costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing our vehicles, battery and AI compute technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure. We have continued to expand and refine our Robotaxi service after its June 2025 launch, capitalizing on our AI investments and scalable mobility infrastructure to advance a service-driven business model. In 2025, we deployed 32.5 GWh of energy storage products through the third quarter. We are focused on ramping the production, increasing the market penetration of our energy storage products, developing our battery technologies and vertically integrating, localizing and expanding our supply chain. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized total revenues of $28.10 billion and $69.93 billion, respectively, representing an increase of $2.91 billion and a decrease of $2.06 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.37 billion and $2.95 billion, respectively, representing decreases of $800 million and $2.01 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing capacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth. We ended the third quarter of 2025 with $41.65 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $5.08 billion from the end of 2024. Our cash flows provided by operating activities were $10.93 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $10.11 billion during the same period ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of $825 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $6.13 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $8.56 billion during the same period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of $2.43 billion. Overall growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue to make critical high-value investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. 28 Table of Contents Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook Automotive and AI Enabled Products—Production The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: Production Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S / Model X Active Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active Gigafactory Texas Model Y Active Cybertruck Active Cybercab Construction Gigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Construction TBD Roadster In development We are focused on growing and optimizing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing newer vehicle models and future vehicles utilizing aspects of our next generation platform, while maximizing production rate and efficiency at our Gigafactories. In the third quarter, we launched several new vehicle options across multiple geographies as we aim to increase utilization of our manufacturing footprint and expand our addressable markets, including the Model YL, Model Y Performance and Model 3 and Model Y Standard. The next phase of production growth will be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to manufacture our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness. We are also capitalizing on our strengths in real-world AI data to advance the development of Optimus, a general purpose, autonomous humanoid robot. These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, changes to fiscal and trade policy with respect to tariffs, export controls and other restrictions may impact our global supply chain cost structure and availability, affecting not only vehicle production, but also facility expansions. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles. Automotive and AI Enabled Products—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles’ performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features utilizing artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and delivering new vehicles and vehicle options. In addition, we believe the launch of our Robotaxi service unlocks the potential for significant business growth to advance a service-driven business model. We will continue to improve safety and profitability while scaling the network. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers. 29 Table of Contents However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to shifting consumer trends, political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, as inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which impacted the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in the automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, cost structure and the competitive landscape. While the final scope and application of recently announced changes in trade policy remain uncertain at this time, higher tariffs on imports and subsequent retaliatory tariffs could adversely impact consumer spending and demand for durable goods and related services. Furthermore, certain provisions of the OBBBA, including the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles, may also impact consumer demand for electric vehicles in general. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction efforts, including through production innovation, process improvements and logistics optimization, and focus on operating leverage, vertical integration and supply chain localization will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors. Our new products, which include more affordable options, and our advances in autonomy, position us for future growth. As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations. In tandem with the launch of our Robotaxi business, we are focused on developing and optimizing dedicated infrastructure, including in relation to vehicle cleaning and maintenance, charging, security, teleoperations and fleet management, to ensure service quality as we continue to scale. Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment The long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production and capabilities of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the ramps of our Megafactories in Shanghai and Lathrop, California, and the construction of a new Megafactory near Houston, Texas. In the third quarter, we launched Megapack 3 and Megablock, our next-generation industrial storage product. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones and logistics. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products. At the same time, changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. For instance, import tariffs by the US government and the provisions of the OBBBA could significantly increase battery cell expenses and impact costs for our consumers, negatively impacting consumer demand. Despite these challenges, as AI infrastructure drives rapid load growth, we see opportunities for our energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity. 30 Table of Contents Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions and shifting global trade and fiscal policy. We are simultaneously developing and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. While we prepare for near-term challenges to our business under current policies, we are focused on long-term growth opportunities as we continue to make critical, high-value investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $9.00 billion in 2025. Changes in fiscal and trade policy may necessitate adjustments to our project timelines, potentially impacting our cash flow and capital expenditure expectations. Our business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to invest in autonomy, further vertically integrate our supply chain, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales .

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Recoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Recoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the headings “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I and “Our Business — Challenges and Risks” in  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as the heading “Operations Review” below, for additional information related to our present business environment. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing impairment tests of equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets in various regions around the world. The performance of impairment tests involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, long-term growth rates, discount rates, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more difficult to estimate given the highly volatile global financial markets. As these factors are often interdependent and may not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor.

In November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of, BodyArmor, which offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. During 2021, in conjunction with acquiring the remaining ownership interest, we recognized a noncash gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The Company allocated $4.2 billion of the $5.6 billion purchase price to the BodyArmor trademark. During the three months ended March 29, 2024, the operating results related to the trademark were lower than expected. Therefore, the Company revised its projections of the future operating results related to the trademark, which triggered the need to update its impairment analysis. As a result, the Company concluded that the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of $760 million. The decrease in fair value was primarily driven by the revised projections of future operating results as well as higher discount rates resulting from changes in macroeconomic conditions since the acquisition date. As of September 26, 2025, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. If the near-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our revised financial projections, or if the macroeconomic conditions change causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an additional impairment charge. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in future periods.

Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands In order to continually improve upon the Company’s operating performance, from time to time we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company’s performance.

In addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company’s performance. Unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company’s unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below.

For Costa Limited (“Costa”) non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below. When we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading “Net Operating Revenues” below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate sales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. When we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable.

We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. We generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as “structural changes,” which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company’s unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures.

Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures. “Acquired brands” refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change. “Acquired brands” refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change. “Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change. “Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold.

Beverage Volume Beverage Volume We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and “unit case volume” means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers.

While the OECD issued draft language for the international implementation of Pillar One in October 2023, both the substantive rules and implementation process remain under discussion at the OECD, so the timetable for any implementation remains uncertain. In December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, and the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective domestic laws. The directive requires, with certain limited exceptions, the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023. Numerous countries have enacted legislation that implemented certain aspects of Pillar Two effective January 1, 2024, while many others have indicated their intent to adopt, or have adopted, legislation effective in 2025. On June 28, 2025, the Group of Seven (G7) released a statement announcing an understanding of a potential “side-by-side system” approach to the Pillar Two framework that would exclude U.S.-parented groups from certain Pillar Two provisions in recognition of existing U.S. minimum tax rules. The OECD and implementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance. The Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate. In December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, and the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective domestic laws. The directive requires, with certain limited exceptions, the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023. Numerous countries have enacted legislation that implemented certain aspects of Pillar Two effective January 1, 2024, while many others have indicated their intent to adopt, or have adopted, legislation effective in 2025. On June 28, 2025, the Group of Seven (G7) released a statement announcing an understanding of a potential “side-by-side system” approach to the Pillar Two framework that would exclude U.S.-parented groups from certain Pillar Two provisions in recognition of existing U.S. minimum tax rules. The OECD and implementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance. The Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate.

We are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in concluding both that certain U.S. tax regulations (known as the blocked-income regulations) that address the effect of certain Brazilian legal restrictions on royalty payments by the Company’s licensee in Brazil apply to the Company’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in the 3M case controlled as to the validity of those regulations. On October 1, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the judgment of the Tax Court in the 3M case. In its decision, the court concluded that the blocked-income regulation was inconsistent with IRC Section 482 and that the IRS therefore could not reallocate income from 3M’s subsidiary in Brazil to 3M in contravention of Brazilian We are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009.

Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit specifically rejected the IRS’ argument that the ability of 3M’s subsidiary in Brazil to pay dividends, rather than royalties, meant that royalty income should not be treated as blocked. Both of these conclusions are highly supportive of the Company’s position in its case and reinforce its prior conclusions. On August 2, 2024, the Tax Court entered a decision reflecting additional federal income tax of $2.7 billion for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. With applicable interest, the total liability for the 2007 through 2009 tax years resulting from the Tax Court’s decision is $6.0 billion, for which the IRS issued the Company invoices on September 3, 2024. The Company paid the IRS Tax Litigation Deposit on September 10, 2024, which stopped interest from accruing on the additional tax due for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. That amount, plus interest earned, would be refunded in full or in part if the Company’s tax positions are ultimately sustained on appeal. For the three and nine months ended September 26, 2025, the Company recorded net interest income of $55 million and $162 million, respectively, related to this tax payment in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statements of income, in accordance with our accounting policy. The payment of the IRS invoices and the related accrued interest were recorded in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of September 26, 2025 and December 31, 2024. On October 22, 2024, the Company appealed the Tax Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Company filed its principal appellate brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on March 12, 2025. The IRS filed its appellate brief on July 7, 2025. The Company filed its reply brief on August 27, 2025. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would not receive a refund of the applicable portion or all of the $6.0 billion it paid in response to the IRS invoices issued in September 2024 and the related accrued interest receivable of $313 million as of September 26, 2025. Additionally, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company estimates that the potential aggregate remaining incremental tax and interest liability for the tax years 2010 through 2024 could be approximately $12 billion as of December 31, 2024. Additional income tax and interest on any unpaid potential liabilities for the 2010 through 2024 tax years would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. The Company estimates the impact of the continued application of the methodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinions for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2025 would increase the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability by approximately $400 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 26, 2025 and September 27, 2024 was $3,652 million and $2,854 million, respectively, an increase of $798 million or 28%. The increase was primarily driven by strong cash operating results, lower tax payments, the transfer of surplus non-U.S. plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company and the timing of changes in working capital. These items were partially offset by the prior year benefits of both the trade accounts receivable factoring program and the dividend payment from an equity method investee in Thailand, higher marketing payments, unfavorable hedging activity and higher net interest payments, as well as the unfavorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Results of Operations The following represents our consolidated performance highlights (1) : Three Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 Q3'25 vs. Q3'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Financial Results: Revenues $ 11,510,307 $ 9,824,703 $ 1,685,604 17 % Constant currency change in revenues (2) 17 % Operating income $ 3,248,247 $ 2,909,477 $ 338,770 12 % Operating margin 28.2 % 29.6 % (1.4) % Net income $ 2,546,916 $ 2,363,509 $ 183,407 8 % (1) We have discontinued the quarterly reporting of membership numbers, focusing instead on revenue and operating margin as the primary financial metrics that we believe best represent our business performance. Effective with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, we discontinued reporting streaming membership metrics, including paid net membership additions (losses), paid memberships at end of period, average paying memberships and average monthly revenue per paying membership. (2) See the “Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information” section below for additional details on our use of constant currency revenue. Operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased by approximately one percentage point as compared to the prior comparative period. The decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by the growth in cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenses outpacing the growth in revenues, partially offset by a slower rate of growth in technology and development expenses and general and administrative expenses relative to revenue growth. Net income fo r the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased $183 million as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to a $339 million increase in operating income, driven by a $1,686 million increase in revenues and partially offset by a $1,044 million increase in cost of revenues primarily due to the increase in other cost of revenues and content amortization. The impact of higher operating income was partially offset by a $223 million increase in the provision for income taxes. 25 Table of Contents Revenues We primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of September 30, 2025, pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $35 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $9 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations. We also earn revenues from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live experiences and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024.

Additionally, revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging. The following tables summarize revenues by region for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Total revenues are inclusive of hedging gains (losses) of $(129) million and $(2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and $48 million and $70 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on revenue, we calculate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period and exclude the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues. Constant currency percentage change in revenues is calculated as the percentage change between current period constant currency revenue and the prior comparative period revenue. The impact of hedging gains or losses is excluded from both the current and prior periods. The tables below summarize constant currency revenues by region for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and the constant currency percentage change in revenues by region for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 Q3'25 vs. Q3'24 As Reported Constant Currency Adjustment Hedging (Gains) Losses Included in Revenues Constant Currency Revenues As Reported Hedging (Gains) Losses Included in Revenues Revenues Less Hedging Impact Reported Change Constant Currency Change (in thousands, except percentages) UCAN $ 5,071,781 $ 1,816 $ (2,196) $ 5,071,401 $ 4,322,476 $ (3,265) $ 4,319,211 17 % 17 % EMEA 3,699,052 (199,597) 113,580 3,613,035 3,133,466 (1,857) 3,131,609 18 % 15 % LATAM 1,370,913 53,678 26,300 1,450,891 1,240,892 (34,654) 1,206,238 10 % 20 % APAC 1,368,561 (14,750) (8,319) 1,345,492 1,127,869 (8,408) 1,119,461 21 % 20 % Total Revenues $ 11,510,307 $ (158,853) $ 129,365 $ 11,480,819 $ 9,824,703 $ (48,184) $ 9,776,519 17 % 17 % Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 YTD'25 vs. YTD'24 As Reported Constant Currency Adjustment Hedging (Gains) Losses Included in Revenues Constant Currency Revenues As Reported Hedging (Gains) Losses Included in Revenues Revenues Less Hedging Impact Reported Change Constant Currency Change (in thousands, except percentages) UCAN $ 14,617,882 $ 33,190 $ (23,179) $ 14,627,893 $ 12,842,351 $ (5,617) $ 12,836,734 14 % 14 % EMEA 10,641,903 (175,286) 50,404 10,517,021 9,099,431 (12,514) 9,086,917 17 % 16 % LATAM 3,939,582 458,052 26,397 4,424,031 3,610,045 (30,147) 3,579,898 9 % 24 % APAC 3,932,907 31,327 (51,668) 3,912,566 3,202,626 (21,966) 3,180,660 23 % 23 % Total Revenues $ 33,132,274 $ 347,283 $ 1,954 $ 33,481,511 $ 28,754,453 $ (70,244) $ 28,684,209 15 % 17 % 27 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues primarily consists of the amortization of content assets.

Expenses related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content not included in content amortization may include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other personnel-related expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production-related costs and participations and residuals. Streaming delivery costs are primarily related to our global content delivery network (“Open Connect”). We have built our own Open Connect network to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operating costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.

Three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 Q3'25 vs. Q3'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest expense $ 175,294 $ 184,830 $ (9,536) (5) % As a percentage of revenues 2 % 2 % Nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 YTD'25 vs. YTD'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest expense $ 542,115 $ 526,130 $ 15,985 3 % As a percentage of revenues 2 % 2 % Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our Notes of $175 million and $541 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. The decrease in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the lower average aggregate principal of our Notes outstanding. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the higher average aggregate principal of our Notes outstanding. Interest and Other Income (Expense) Interest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 30 Table of Contents Three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 Q3'25 vs. Q3'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income (expense) $ 36,457 $ (21,693) $ 58,150 268 % As a percentage of revenues — % — % Interest and other income (expense) increased in the three months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $25 million, net of the impacts of derivatives and hedging, compared to losses of $91 million for the corresponding period in 2024. In the three months ended September 30, 2025, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the non-cash loss of $105 million from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euro, net of hedging impacts, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. The change in foreign currency gains and losses was partially offset by a $9 million decrease in interest income earned in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding period in 2024. Nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 YTD'25 vs. YTD'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Interest and other income (expense) $ 126,986 $ 212,671 $ (85,685) (40) % As a percentage of revenues — % 1 % Interest and other income (expense) decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $97 million, net of the impacts of derivatives and hedging, compared to gains of $24 million for the corresponding period in 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the non-cash loss of $82 million from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euro, net of hedging impacts, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the foreign exchange gains were primarily driven by the non-cash gain of $69 million from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euro, net of hedging impacts, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. The change in foreign currency gains and losses was partially offset by a $15 million increase in interest income earned in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding period in 2024. Provision for Income Taxes Three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 Q3'25 vs. Q3'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 562,494 $ 339,445 $ 223,049 66 % Effective tax rate 18 % 13 % Nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 YTD'25 vs. YTD'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 1,392,131 $ 988,365 $ 403,766 41 % Effective tax rate 14 % 13 % The increase in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024, was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits associated with federal research and development tax credits, as well as the lower growth in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction relative to the growth in income before income taxes. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of Change September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 September 30, 2025 vs. December 31, 2024 (in thousands, except percentages) Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments $ 9,327,973 $ 9,586,343 $ (258,370) (3) % Short-term and long-term debt 14,463,020 15,582,804 (1,119,784) (7) % Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments decreased $258 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to the repurchase of stock and repayment of debt, partially offset by cash provided by operations and proceeds from issuance of common stock. Debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, decreased $1,120 million primarily due to approximately $1,833 million in repayments of debt, partially offset by the remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The amount of principal and interest on our outstanding notes due in the next twelve months is $690 million. As of September 30, 2025, no amounts had been borrowed under the $3 billion Revolving Credit Agreement or the $3 billion Commercial Paper Program. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that we may periodically raise additional debt capital. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for the refinancing of upcoming maturities or potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. In September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in December 2024, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $15 billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company repurchased 6,765,397 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $7.0 billion (excluding the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022). As of September 30, 2025, $10.1 billion remains available for repurchases. Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery, and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. Our other uses of cash include strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as share repurchases. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond. Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of September 30, 2025, the expected timing of those payments are as follows: Payments due by Period Contractual obligations (in thousands): Total Next 12 Months Beyond 12 Months Content obligations (1) $ 20,940,900 $ 11,267,688 $ 9,673,212 Debt (2) 18,394,940 690,341 17,704,599 Operating lease obligations (3) 3,031,727 574,669 2,457,058 Total $ 42,367,567 $ 12,532,698 $ 29,834,869 32 Table of Contents (1) As of September 30, 2025, content obligations were comprised of $4.1 billion included in “Current content liabilities” and $1.6 billion of “Non-current content liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $15.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition. The material cash requirements above do not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above. (2) Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further details. (3) Operating lease obligations are comprised of operating lease liabilities included in \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\" and \"Other non-current liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, inclusive of imputed interest. Operating lease obligations also include additional obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not meet the criteria for recognition. See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. In addition to the material cash requirements summarized in the table above, we expect to pay deposits of $619 million related to non-income tax assessments in Brazil as described further in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies . During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we also paid tax deposits of approximately $200 million related to certain direct taxes that exceeded our regularly recurring obligations. Cash Flows The following tables summarize our cash flows: Three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 Q3'25 vs. Q3'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,825,174 $ 2,321,101 $ 504,073 22 % Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 43,871 (1,869,109) 1,912,980 102 % Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,737,029) 226,596 (1,963,625) (867) % Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased $504 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily driven by a $454 million increase in adjustments for non-cash expenses, $396 million in favorable changes in working capital, and a $183 million or 8% increase in net income, partially offset by a $530 million increase in payments for content assets. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased $1,913 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily due to net cash inflows of $172 million from maturities, sales and purchases of investments in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to cash outflows of $1,742 million from purchases of investments in the corresponding period in 2024, partially offset by a $38 million increase in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased $1,964 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily due to no proceeds from the issuance of debt in the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,794 million in the corresponding period in 2024, coupled with a $157 million decrease in cash flows related to higher repurchases of common stock in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding period in 2024. 33 Table of Contents Nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended Change September 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 YTD'25 vs. YTD'24 (in thousands, except percentages) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 8,037,631 $ 5,824,470 $ 2,213,161 38 % Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 1,298,217 (2,023,110) 3,321,327 164 % Net cash used in financing activities (8,268,213) (3,395,729) 4,872,484 143 % Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased $2,213 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily driven by a $1,720 million or 25% increase in net income and a $941 million increase in adjustments for non-cash expenses, partially offset by $241 million in unfavorable changes in working capital and a $207 million increase in payments for content assets. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased $3,321 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily due to net cash inflows of $1,747 million from maturities, sales and purchases of investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to cash outflows of $1,742 million from purchases of investments in the corresponding period in 2024, partially offset by a $168 million increase in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased $4,872 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily driven by changes in cash flows related to the issuance and repayment of debt. The increase in financing cash outflows was primarily driven by no proceeds from the issuance of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,794 million, in the corresponding period in 2024, coupled with a $1,433 million increase in repayments of debt. In addition, repurchases of common stock increased $1,748 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the corresponding period in 2024.
